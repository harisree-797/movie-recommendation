# Amazon Prime Movies Recommendation System

This project is an interactive movie recommendation system built using Python and Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab. The system allows users to filter and get movie recommendations based on several criteria such as movie name, language, IMDb rating, running time, year of release, and maturity rating.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about 8,127 movies available on Amazon Prime, with the following columns:

- **Movie Name**: The title of the movie.
- **Language**: The language in which the movie is available.
- **IMDb Rating**: The IMDb rating of the movie.
- **Running Time**: The duration of the movie.
- **Year of Release**: The year the movie was released.
- **Maturity Rating**: The maturity rating of the movie (e.g., 18+, All).
- **Plot**: A brief summary or description of the movie's plot.

## Features

- **Interactive Widgets**: Users can input their preferences using dropdowns and sliders.
- **Real-time Filtering**: The system filters movies based on user-selected criteria and displays recommendations in real-time.
- **Flexible Year Selection**: Users can select a year, and the system will include all movies released after the selected year.
